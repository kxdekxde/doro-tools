# DORO Tools

All of my tools to mod [NIKKE](https://nikke-en.com/) bundles. Thanks to Bingle, Danieru, Na0h and majiko for the help.



## Requirements to use the scripts:

  - Download and install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe), and install the necessary dependencies following [this video](https://files.catbox.moe/vqsuix.mp4).

  - Double-click `1_INSTALL_REQUIREMENTS.bat` to start the download and installation of the remaining requirements.



## Modding tools installation:

Double-click on `2_DORO_TOOLS_UPDATER.bat` and wait for it to finish to download the modding tools. If the download fails close the terminal window and retry.
The modding tools will be located in the folder _DORO_Tools_, from there you can use them as before when they were packed executable files.


## Modding tools usage:

Most of the tools have got a batch file _X_MAINBATFILE.bat_, double-click on it to launch the tool window and then you can start to use the tool from there.


## For updates:

You can double-click on `2_DORO_TOOLS_UPDATER.bat` for updates as well to download them when there are updates available, but read the warning message carefully because the update will clean all of the modding tools folders for a fresh download.


Happy modding! ^â€¿^
